The Real Slim Shady
[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him17
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose

And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids26
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
